# Principles

* Don't make 9th offence by popularizing Krishna name boldly
* No startup mode or overworking, artha flow must be organic, sattvic
* Love, care and respect for people at the core. Augmenting person's story and solving it
* Not material prosperity and expansion, but quality and intensity of experience (perfect kirtan, perfect prasadam, perfect conversation, perfect arati, perfect knowledge of questions).
* Krsna like the best, only best parts should be offered
* Bhashya style: every action should remind the highest final goal: to please Krishna
